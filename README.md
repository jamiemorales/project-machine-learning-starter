# Machine Learning Starters

## About

Machine Learning Starters is a collection of fast fundamental machine learning practice sets in Python for starters.

It aims to help someone get started fast and gain a high-level understanding of the fundamental steps in the machine learning lifecycle early on.

After completion, someone will have built intuition over the machine learning lifecycle.
